Introduction

This notebook aims to provide an introduction to both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, showcasing how they can be applied in real-world scenarios. It includes theoretical explanations, practical applications, and visualizations to enhance understanding.

Supervised Learning

Overview
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The model learns to map input features to the correct output labels.

Key Algorithms
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Implementation Examples
[Insert example code snippets or descriptions of what the notebook covers in this section.]

Unsupervised Learning

Overview
Unsupervised Learning involves training a model on data without labeled responses. The model tries to identify patterns and group the data based on inherent structures.

Key Algorithms
K-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
